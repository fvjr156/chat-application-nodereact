Here's how to run this application:

1. clone this into your directory
2. type ``cd backend`` and ``npm install`` to install node dependencies on backend
3. type ``npm run dev`` to start the backend server. access it at ``localhost:5000``
4. if the site returns ``["This express.js app is working"]``, the backend is running properly, congratulations!
5. now go to frontend by typing ``cd ../frontend``, then ``npm install`` to install node dependencies on frontend
6. type ``npm start`` and wait for React app to start on ``localhost:3000``. You can also type the URL if the app took too long to automatically fire up the browser when React app ran successfully.   
7. if the 'Stored Messages' contains the below message, it means that the SQLite and the React frontend is running properly, congratulations!
```
<2023-01-01:00:00:00> sqlite: Hello World!
<2023-01-01:00:00:00> sqlite: Congratulations, the app runs properly!
```
8. Go to ``localhost:5000/delete/confirm`` to delete the above messages then restart the frontend webpage to see ``There's nothing here. Add a message!``.
9. Go and use or improve my code! You can contribute your improvements by pushing to a new branch. Please contact me if you are restricted by GitHub to do so.
